# C-Neural-Net
C project extension - Neural network in C

This code was written as part of a first year project that involved writing an emulator and assembler for a 64-bit ARM processor. This extension was written by myself as part of this project.
This code can train a basic neural network when given training data. In main a simple XOR example is laid out, with outputs written to two txt files during training.
